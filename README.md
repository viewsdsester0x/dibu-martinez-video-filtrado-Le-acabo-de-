Emiliano “Dibu” Martínez, Argentina’s celebrated goalkeeper and a key figure in their 2022 FIFA World Cup victory, has once again captured the internet’s attention. This time, it’s not his heroic saves or on-field antics making headlines, but a humorous video widely shared under the phrase **“todo trabado”** (“all jacked”). The video highlights not just Dibu’s unique personality but also the internet’s fascination with turning even the most mundane moments into viral sensations.

### **The Video: What’s It About?**  
The phrase “todo trabado” emerged in connection with a casual video where Dibu Martínez shows off his physical form while relaxing off the field. In the clip, the goalkeeper playfully flexes his muscles, seemingly embracing his growing image as a larger-than-life personality. Fans quickly latched onto his confident yet comedic display, dubbing the video with the catchphrase, which translates to “all ripped” or “completely muscular” in colloquial Spanish.  

Though the video was meant to be lighthearted, it spiraled into a massive trend on platforms like TikTok, Twitter, and Instagram. Memes, reaction videos, and remixes flooded social media, turning Dibu’s playful moment into a pop culture phenomenon.

Dibu Martínez has always been a charismatic figure. Known for his fearless demeanor on the field and cheeky mind games with opponents during penalty shootouts, he has become a fan favorite both in Argentina and globally.
